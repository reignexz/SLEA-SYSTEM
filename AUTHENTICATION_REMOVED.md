## 🎯 **Current State:**

### **✅ What Works:**

- **Document Download**: Works without user access control
- **Action Buttons**: Approve/Reject/Return/Flag all work
- **Sample Data**: 5 students, 5 submissions with documents

## 🚀 **Ready for Your Teammate:**

### **Authentication Integration Points:**
1. **Add Authentication Middleware**: Apply to assessor routes when ready
2. **User Filtering**: Add back `->assignedTo($user->id)` in pendingSubmissions()
3. **Access Control**: Add user validation in API methods
4. **Profile Management**: Implement profile update methods with authentication

### **Sample Data Available:**
- **Students**: 5 sample students with realistic data
- **Submissions**: 5 submissions across different SLEA sections
- **Documents**: Multiple files per submission (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- **User**: First user in database is used as assessor

## 🧪 **Testing:**

1. **Access**: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/assessor/pending-submissions`
2. **Should Work**: No authentication errors
3. **View Submissions**: Click "View" on any submission
4. **Test Actions**: Try Approve/Reject/Return/Flag
5. **Download Files**: Test document download functionality

## 📝 **For Your Teammate:**

When implementing authentication, you'll need to:

1. **Add Authentication Middleware** to assessor routes
2. **Restore User Filtering** in `pendingSubmissions()` method
3. **Add Access Control** to API methods
