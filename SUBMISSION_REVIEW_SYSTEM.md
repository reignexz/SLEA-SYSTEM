# Submission Review System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The Assessor Dashboard has been updated with a comprehensive submission review system that replaces the plain score editing with an auto-generated score display plus assessor decision workflow.

## New Features Implemented

### 1. Database Models and Migrations
- **Student Model**: Stores student information (ID, name, email, program, etc.)
- **Submission Model**: Manages submission data with auto-generated scoring
- **Document Model**: Handles file uploads and metadata

### 2. Enhanced Pending Submissions Page
- **Dynamic Data Loading**: Real submissions from database instead of static data
- **Review Modal**: Complete redesign with structured layout
- **Auto-Generated Scoring**: System calculates scores based on submission criteria

### 3. Modal Components

#### Student Details Panel
- Student ID
- Student Name  
- Document Title
- Date Submitted

- Subsection
- Role in Activity
- Activity Date

- Description (if available)

#### Uploaded Document Preview
- File type detection (PDF, JPG, PNG)
- Download functionality
- Preview capability for images
- File size display

#### System Auto-Generated Score
- Readonly display of calculated points
- Based on role, SLEA section, and content quality
- Scoring algorithm considers:
  - Role hierarchy (President: +15, Vice President: +12, etc.)
  - SLEA section importance (Leadership: +10, Academic: +8, etc.)
  - Content completeness (organizing body: +3, description: +5)

#### Assessor Remarks
- Optional textarea for feedback
- Required for Reject, Return, and Flag actions

#### Action Buttons
- **‚úÖ Approve**: Marks as verified, accepts auto score
- **‚ùå Reject**: Rejects submission with required reason
- **‚Ü© Return to Student**: Sends back for resubmission with remarks
- **üö© Flag for Admin**: Raises to admin for review with reason

### 4. Backend API Endpoints

#### GET `/assessor/submissions/{id}/details`
- Fetches complete submission data
- Calculates auto-generated score if not present
- Returns student info, documents, and scoring data

#### POST `/assessor/submissions/{id}/action`
- Handles assessor actions (approve/reject/return/flag)
- Validates required remarks for certain actions
- Updates submission status and timestamps

#### GET `/assessor/documents/{id}/download`
- Downloads document files securely
- Validates file existence and permissions

### 5. Auto-Generated Scoring Algorithm

```php
Base Score: 70 points
+ Role Bonus: 5-15 points (based on position hierarchy)
+ SLEA Section Bonus: 6-10 points (based on section importance)
+ Content Bonus: 3 points (if organizing body specified)
+ Description Bonus: 5 points (if detailed description provided)
= Final Score (capped at 100)
```

### 6. UI/UX Improvements
- **Clean Layout**: Structured form with labels on left, values on right
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop
